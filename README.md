Imgeneus is a simple and elegant Shaiya EP3 socket server over the TCP/IP protocol, built with C# 8 and .NET Core Framework 3.0.

This project has been created for learning purposes about the network and game logic problematics on the server-side.
We choose [Shaiya](https://shaiya.fandom.com/wiki/Main_Page) because  it is a simple game, but enough complex to learn the basic functions of an MMO game architecture.
